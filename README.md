# 6502-OS
This is a side project of mine to learn the basics of assembly. I have decided to start with oldstyle 8-bit assembly for the W65C02S Microprocessor. I have a breadboard wired up to connect several IC's together to support ROM, RAM, and I/O connections. This repo is to mainly version control my progress as I tinker with assembly for the computer.

I have been following [Ben Eater's](https://eater.net/6502) amazing work as a guide, but do plan to branch off and write some custom software for the computer once I have the fundementals implemented.
